  <title>Global Checkin</title>
   <sect1>
<para>When a User edits a file after logging in, they Check It Out. This
      prevents other Users from being able to edit the document at the same
      time, thus preventing loss of data upon saving.</para>

      <para>When the User clicks Save or Cancel, the file should be checked
      back in. If there is a connection error, or the user presses the Back
      button in his or her browser, a file can stay checked out, meaning no
      one can edit it.</para>

      <para>If you want to be able to edit the file, you can perform a Global
      Checkin. Be very careful in doing this. Anyone who is editing a document
      at that very moment can have his or her work lost.</para>

      <para>To perform the Check In, click on System &gt; Global Check In from
      the menu bar in the Admin Section. You will get a list of all items and
      it will show you how many items, and from which tables, are Checked back
      in.</para>
